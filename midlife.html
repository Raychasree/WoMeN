         <p> Keep up your healthy habits and practice self-care as you balance family and career. <br>Life in your 40s can be filled with transitions that bring on high levels of stress. You may be taking care of everyone at homeâ€”growing children and aging parentsâ€”while also working hard to achieve milestones in your career.

Self-care is especially important during this phase of your life. Along with the demands of everyday responsibilities, your body is going through subtle hormonal changes that can raise your risk of high blood pressure, heart disease and other chronic illnesses.

    <h2><span>Heart Attack Symptoms Women may Not Recognize</span></h2>
    <p>Learn how to recognize the early and subtle warning signs of heart attacks in women. You could help prevent a tragedy by picking up on these surprising signals. 

Every year, about 435,000 women in the US have heart attacks, which kill 6 times more women than breast cancer. Of these women, 71% experience early warning signs like extreme fatigue, but many don't recognize their symptoms as signs of a heart attack.<br>When you imagine a heart attack, you might picture what you see in the movies: a man clutching his chest in pain, followed by the discovery of a big clot in an artery on a EKG.</p>
<h3 style="color:gold;">HEART ATTACK SYMPTOMS</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 400px;"><span>1.</span>high cholesterol<br>
<span>2.</span>pain in the back, neck, jaw, or throat<br>
<span>3.</span>Indigestion<br>
<span>4.</span>Heartburn<br>
<span>5.</span>Vomiting<br>
<span>6.</span>Extreme fatigue(tiredness)<br>
<span>7.</span>Problems breathing (shortness of breath)</p>
<p>Prevention is everyone's responsibility. "Get heart-checked," Dr. Bairey Merz says. "This is where a physician will look at risk factors to determine whether you should take medication daily to reduce your risk."
While some risk factors for a heart attack can't be changed, like age and race, some canâ€”like smoking, cholesterol levels, inactivity, and high blood pressure. Take control of your heart health today to lower your chances of heart problems in the future.</p>

   <br> <h2><span>Demystifying Mammograms</span></h2>
    <h3 style="color:white;">"Every woman's level of risk is different. Make the choice that's best for you."</h3>
<p>Since new breast cancer screening guidelines came out in 2015, women have heard a lot of conflicting advice about whenâ€”and how oftenâ€”to get a mammogram.

The US Preventive Services Task Force suggests women ages 50-74 get a mammogram every other year. They also suggest women under 50 talk with their doctor to decide if they should start mammograms sooner, taking into consideration individual risk factors.<br>The American Cancer Society advises women with average risk to begin annual mammograms at age 45, then switch to every other year at age 55.

Other organizations, including the American College of Surgeons and the American College of Radiology, still recommend annual screening mammograms for all women over the age of 40.

</p><br>
<h3 style="color:orange">What's a woman to do?</span><br>
<p>women start annual mammograms in their 40s and talk with their doctors about the risks and benefits.

"I still strongly believe that all womenâ€”even average risk womenâ€”should consider having annual mammograms in their 40s," she says. "The risk of breast cancer definitely rises as you get older."

The US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines were changed due to growing concerns over false positive test results that prompted needless additional tests and biopsies. They're also in line with the overall trend away from one-size-fits-all guidelines to a more individualized approach to healthcare.

"The US Preventive Task Force was concerned that false positives and unnecessary biopsies were causing harm," says Dr. Dang. "But mammograms for women between the ages of 40 and 50 do save lives."

All guidelines urge women and their healthcare providers to have frank discussions about the risks and benefits of screening, and for each woman to make an informed choice based on her situation.<br></p>
<h3 style="color:orange;">The bottom line</h3>
<p>For women under age 35 with no complicating factors, try for a year before seeking a fertility specialist. For women older than 35, go in for an evaluation after six months.

Dr. Pisarska recommends women age 40 or older immediately talk to fertility specialists for an evaluation, as they more often have difficulty getting pregnant. If they're going to need medical interventions for their fertility, it's better to know that from the beginning. "We're dealing with a time factor, and we do not want to miss our window of opportunity to help couples," she says.

"Women who feel confused should definitely talk to their healthcare provider, because every woman's level of risk is different," Dr. Dang says. "It's based on your family history, your reproductive history, and your medical conditions. Make the choice that's best for you."

To schedule a mammogram, talk to your healthcare provider. </p>
