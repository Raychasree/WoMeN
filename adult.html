    <h2><span>Too Young For Heart Disease?</span></h2>
    <p>If you have a family history of heart disease or other risk factors such as adverse pregnancy or diabetes, you should be getting screenings and taking precautions, by specialised docyors.

Younger women are often focused on their careers, their families, and their lives. Theyâ€™re not usually thinking about heart disease. <br></p>
<h3 style="color:gold;">What are the most common risk factors for heart disease and what annual tests should women take?</h2>
<h3 style="color:orange; text-align: center;">There are five traditional risk factors linked to heart disease:</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 400px;"><span>1.</span>high cholesterol<br>
<span>2.</span>high blood pressure<br>
<span>3.</span>diabetes<br>
<span>4.</span>family history<br>
<span>5.</span>smoking</p>
<p>Every year a woman should have her blood pressure checked and an exam that includes someone listening to her heart. Also, women should make sure to have a fasting cholesterol and blood sugar test to check for pre-diabetes or diabetes. Around 35-44 years old is a good time to have an evaluation by an internist. If you do have a family history of heart disease and stroke, this may put you in a different bracket because your genetics can increase your heart health risk. You should discuss preventative measures with your doctor.</p>
<h3 style="color:gold;">Why are younger women less aware of the risk of heart disease?</h2>
<p>If you look at younger women between the ages of 35 and 44, they are generally leading a healthy lifestyle by being active, fit, and eating a balanced diet; they don't think heart disease could impact them. I call them the "walking well." They are at the early prime of their lives; we think of mid-life as 50 and older. These younger women have possibly started a family, focused on a career, and think of themselves as healthy. They are more concentrated on their lives than heart health, yet the rate of heart disease deaths are starting to trend upward in these younger women and we really need to look at why.</p>

   <br> <h2><span>INFERTILITY:What You Need to Know</span></h2>
    <h3 style="color:white;">About 1 in 8 couples struggle with infertility. What should you do if you're among them?</h3>
<p>Wanting children may shape where a couple decides to live, which car they drive, and countless other choices.

While they're getting their lives ready for a family, fertility experts suggest they also make sure their bodies are ready. About 1 in 8 couples struggle with infertility.<br>"You hope and expect you can have a family any time you want, and when you find it is more difficult than you had imagined, it puts a lot of stress on everybody involved," she says. "We try to minimize that stress, but it is very hard. We hope some of our discoveries will transform the field of infertility and help more people in the future."

Taking care of your bodyâ€”eating healthy foods, exercising, maintaining a healthy weightâ€”is a good start. Here's what else you should know if you'd like to have children today or down the road.

</p><br>
<h3 style="color:orange">Know your body</span><br>
<p>"I tell my patients to take charge of their reproductive health," Dr. Pisarska says. Women who want to have children don't have to wait for the "right time"â€”or even a partnerâ€”to know their bodies.

She suggests that women have candid talks with their doctor about their fertility, including their egg and uterine health. "It's important for women to assess their fertility to see where they stand in terms of their own bodies," she says. "This may impact their decision to hold off on family planning and plan for a family sooner."

Tests can assess ovarian health and determine how many eggs a woman has, and ultrasounds can check for factors like fibroids that may affect uterine health.<br>
<h3 style="color:orange;">When to seek help for infertility</h3>
<p>For women under age 35 with no complicating factors, try for a year before seeking a fertility specialist. For women older than 35, go in for an evaluation after six months.

Dr. Pisarska recommends women age 40 or older immediately talk to fertility specialists for an evaluation, as they more often have difficulty getting pregnant. If they're going to need medical interventions for their fertility, it's better to know that from the beginning. "We're dealing with a time factor, and we do not want to miss our window of opportunity to help couples," she says.

If you're having problems, err on the side of seeking help. "Some people say if you don't stress, you'll get pregnant, but if you've been trying for a period of time, you should be evaluated further to see what is contributing to you not getting pregnant instead of simply trying stress reduction." </p>
