    <br><h2 style="color:orange">Major diseases effected at these age:</h2>
    <h2><span>Thyroid</span></h2>
    <p>Your thyroid is a gland that sits in your throat and is part of the endocrine system. It secrets thyroid hormones that are essential to your bodyâ€™s functioning. For instance, your digestion, energy, and mood are affected by your thyroid gland.

Any issues with your thyroid gland are bound to cause symptoms that are hard to ignore. It can affect your overall health, and you will most likely feel something is off. Although very common, most people with thyroid conditions cannot attribute their symptoms to their thyroid, as they are easily confused with other conditions. This is particularly true for young adults who may feel a variety of symptoms due to lifestyle choices, eating habits, stress, and more. The best way to get an accurate diagnosis for a thyroid issue is through testing done through a doctor.<br></p>
<h3 style="color:yellow;">Here are the most common thyroid conditions found in young adults:</h2>
    <p><span>Hyperthyroidism</span><br><br>
This thyroid disorder is characterized by an overactive thyroid gland, which means the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormones. This disorder is more common in women than in men. Some reasons that cause hyperthyroidism are nodules on the thyroid gland that can cause the overproduction of hormones and an autoimmune condition called Gravesâ€™ disease. Hyperthyroidism has a strong genetic component and runs in families.<br><span>Hyperthyroidism causes symptoms such as:</span><br>
Excessive energy , Restlessness , Nervousness , Anxiety , Racing heart , Irritability , Excessive sweating , Shaking and jitters , Increased fidgeting ,Sleep issues , Thin skin , Brittle hair and nails , Muscle weakness , Weight loss , Bulging eyes , Light menstrual ,flow or missed periods<br></p>

   <br> <h2><span>PCOS</span></h2>
    <h3 style="color:white;">What is PCOS?</h3>
<p>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, commonly known as PCOS, is an endocrine system disorder common among women of reproductive age. It is characterized by overproduction of androgen (male hormone), abnormality in menstrual cycles, or the presence of small cysts in ovaries. Ovulation happens when the ovaries release the egg so that the sperm can fertilize it. In the case of PCOS, the woman does not make enough hormones necessary for ovulation. The lack of ovulation results in cyst formation. The cysts produce high levels of male hormones, which hinder a womanâ€™s menstrual cycle and account for the multiple symptoms of PCOS. Although the exact reason for PCOS is unknown, early diagnosis and treatment and weight loss may reduce the risk of multiple morbidities associated with PCOS.</p><br>
<h3 style="color:orange">Its Signs and Symptoms</span><br>
<p>The preliminary signs and symptoms of PCOS usually develop around the first menstrual period during puberty. However, it may also develop later as a result of weight gain. The signs and symptoms of PCOS vary. The signs and symptoms can be typically more severe if the patient is obese. PCOS is typically diagnosed when at least two of the following signs are present in the patient:<br>

<span>Irregular Menstrual Cycle (Periods):</span> A common sign of PCOS is an infrequent, irregular, or prolonged menstrual cycle. For example, having fewer than nine periods a year, or more than 35 days between periods, or abnormally heavy periods are considered irregular periods.<br>
<span>Excess Androgen:</span> Increased levels of male hormones (androgens) may result in physical signs such as hirsutism (excessive facial and body hair) and occasionally male-pattern baldness and severe acne.<br>
<span>Polycystic Ovaries:</span>The ovaries might increase in size and contain follicles that surround the eggs. These follicles do not open and form small cysts. Hence, the ovaries might fail to function regularly. </p>
<h3 style="color:orange;">Diet to Treat PCOS</h3>
<p>Women suffering from PCOS are encouraged to follow a low-fat and low-carbohydrate diet. Such a diet prevents a sudden increase in blood sugar levels and helps keep your weight under control. Girls and women must consume a protein-rich diet and food with a low glycemic index. Take food like Natural and unprocessed foods , Foods high in fibre, Nuts and legumes , whole grains, fish , meat and eggs, Broccoli and cauliflower , spinach,kale and other leafy vegetables daily. </p>
