    <h2><span>Heart Attacks in Women Could Be Flying Under the Radar</span></h2>
    <p>A new Cedars-Sinai study shows that women who complain of chest pain but don't have coronary artery blockages could have experienced undiagnosed heart attacks.

Women who complain about chest pain often are reassured by their doctors that there's no reason to worry because their angiograms show no blockages in the major heart arteries, a primary cause of heart attacks in men.</p>
<h3 style="color:gold;">"Too often, women are told they don't have a heart problem and they are sent home instead of receiving appropriate medical care."</h2>
<p style="margin-left:100px;"><span>1.</span>Of the 340 women in the study who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), a detailed imaging scan of the heart, 8% were found to have myocardial scar, which indicates heart muscle damage.<br>
<span>2.</span>Approximately one-third of those women with myocardial scar were never diagnosed with a heart attack, even though their cardiac scans indicated they had heart muscle damage.<br>
<span>3.</span>Of the 179 women who underwent a one-year follow-up CMR, 1% were found to have myocardial scar that wasn't there the year before; these women had been hospitalized for chest pain in the year since their initial scan, but had not been diagnosed with heart attacks.<br>

   <br> <h2><span>Colon Cancer Patient Lori Wants You to Learn from Her</span></h2>
    <h3 style="color:white;">"Every woman's level of risk is different. Make the choice that's best for you."</h3>
<p>"The wonderful, kick-butt Dr. Ilana Cass and her team came into the ER and told me I had a very large, malignant tumor that needed to be operated on right away," says Lori.

Because of the tumor's location in her abdomen and the symptoms she'd been having, it was unclear where the cancer was coming from. Doctors suspected it was ovarian cancer, but during surgery, Dr. Cass discovered Lori had metastatic colon cancer.
Despite a family history of other cancers, Lori hadn't been getting the recommended screenings.
"I didn't take care of myself because work was my priority," she says. "I had never had a colonoscopy, which you're supposed to start at 50."
The surgeons removed about 97% of the cancer; Lori requires ongoing chemotherapy for the remaining cancer.
"My reaction to getting diagnosed was so different than I thought it would be," Lori recalls. "It wasn't as negative as I expected. I've always been a positive person, and it's really affected how I handle my diagnosis and the treatments."<br>That positive spirit hasn't just influenced Lori's approach to her treatment. It's had an impact on her care team as well.
"Lori embraces her treatment plan and accepts both the good news and the bad news graciously," says her oncologist, Dr. Andrew Hendifar. "She is a fighter and is very proactive about her treatment."
These days, Lori's message is simple: Go to the doctor.
"Don't be afraid of getting a colonoscopy," she says. "If you have symptoms, go see a doctor. Better safe than sorry!" </p>
